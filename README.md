# project cs v2
This is the second iteration of 'project_cs' using mkdocs framework. 
Project CS is an experimental website for Msc CS students of UCD. Students can write notes for lecture 
and maintain them. The main aim is to spread knowledge of CS with everyone and to maintain an archive.
This will act as my primary source of keeping notes, blogs.

The reason for using mkdocs is that it allows for muti-repo documentation thanks spotify for that
Much more scalable, extendable and down right easy to use.

I will use this site for taking notes on

1. Python
2. Ruby
3. Machine Learning
4. Java
5. DSA
6. Personal blog
7. My portfolio


I will try to make a workflow ASAP so that even others can contribute to the archive
